# StackApp

**StackApp** is a stack-based task management application built as a final project for CIS-325. It allows users to register, log in, and manage tasks using a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) system â€” meaning the most recent task is always handled first.

## ðŸ§  Problem It Solves

Most to-do list apps display tasks in a regular list. But many users â€” such as developers and students â€” need to prioritize the **latest task first**. StackApp provides a solution by mimicking a real stack structure, allowing users to add and remove tasks with ease and speed.
